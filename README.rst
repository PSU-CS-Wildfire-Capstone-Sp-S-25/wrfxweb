Submodules
**********

When cloning this repository for local use, you *must* use
::
  git clone --recursive <project url>
to clone this project as well as its submodule dependencies.


Right now, the simulation data is tracked within another repository owned by our repo: https://github.com/PSU-CS-Wildfire-Capstone-Sp-S-25/wrfxweb-simulations. To make changes to the data, work within a copy of that repository and then update your copy of this repo's submodule whenever you push changes to the sim data.
